<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Did you have any issues during setup and if so how did you resolve them, otherwise what did you learn?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The issue which I faced was when I tried to run the flask<br>sample app it showed no module error and when I tried to figure<br>out the issue it seemed there was no problem with the virtual environment<br>and lately I got to know that I did not save my .txt<br>file, and then it successfully ran and gave the output &quot;Hello World&quot;. And<br>also I faced an issue while deploying as it gave an exit code<br>error and then I figured it out by first checking with my .txt<br>file if pyest is installed or not, then it did&#39;nt have pytest and<br>I installed pytest by running the respective command and then again I tried<br>to create a test case showing pass as it gave an exit code<br>5 error which means no tests were collected and ultimately it got deployed.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Docker is a software platform that allows to build, test and deploy applications<br>quickly and execute the application in all environments.<div>The steps to run an application<br>inside a docker are as follows:</div><div>Firstly we create yml files inside the repository<br>which are the deployment files, and these files require secrets like email, api<br>key and dev and prod application name. We use docker to build an<br>image , but in this case we used a pre-built image and then<br>we copy the code into our directory where the container is generated.</div><div>Then it<br>installs all of the requirements and we use gunicorn to run our application<br>which is main.app and then it triggers our application to start accepting the<br>requests.</div><div>We then copy the contents of docker file and place the contents inside<br>our folder i.e., flask-sample with a file named docker file and then we<br>go to github and select actions to check if the app is getting<br>deployed&nbsp; before this we need to source or activate our virtual environment. Then<br>if there is a green tick showing up in the actions it means<br>the app is deployed.</div><div>So, next we go to heroku&#39;s dashboard and select the<br>virtual machine and it shows that it has a container deployed and to<br>test we go to open application and then it displays the contents which<br>indicates the app is running inside the docker container.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Heroku is a widely used platform as a service that enables developers to<br>carry out hassle-free application deployment, scaling and management. It supports wide range of<br>programming languages such as Java, Python, PHP, Node.js and heroku runs applications through<br>virtual containers known as Dynos.&nbsp;<div>Heroku was chosen for this class as it integrates<br>with our github to make it easy to deploy code and it makes<br>app deployment fast and easy. The github integration allows to connect the Heroku<br>app to our github repository and also deploy on every push to github.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Flask is a web application framework developed in python which provides tools, libraries<br>and technologies to build a web application. It is easy to learn and<br>use as it is lightweight and only provides components that are essential. It<br>basically uses jinja2 templates.<div>The things which I learnt using flask was I learnt<br>how we can create a simple web app by installing it , activating<br>virtual environment and how we can run the app in the local machine<br>by accessing the home browser. It was also quite simple using python as<br>it was easy to run the app using flask commands. An also learnt<br>how to test an application using flask , and also locally run a<br>basic flask server.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>The docker file is nothing but a script that uses the docker platform<br>to generate containers. It is basically a text document which contains all the<br>instructions that a user may use it to create an image from the<br>command line. A docker file is a recipe for creating docker images, and<br>a docker image gets built by running a docker command.</div><div>Github Actions use yml<br>to define the workflow and this workflow is stored as a yml file<br>in the repository which is repo in my case and inside my repository<br>I created another directory or file as .github/workflows. The action.yml file basically describes<br>the action and we can create github actions workflow file by adding yml<br>file in the directory .github/workflows.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
